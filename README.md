# MSBA-Data-Projects

This project was completed as part of the machine learning course at UCLA Anderson. The purpose of this project was to go through useful modelling techniques with hands-on data science projects.

## Analysis
1. Regression Analysis - Regression analysis is a statistical technique that is used to estimate the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This analysis is used when the goal is to predict a continuous value, such as predicting the price of a house.

2. Classification Analysis - Classification analysis is a type of supervised learning that is used when the goal is to predict a categorical value. For example, classifying whether an email is spam or not spam.

3. Clustering Analysis - Clustering analysis is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together. This analysis is used when there is no predefined outcome or when the goal is to identify patterns within the data.

4. Dimensionality Reduction - Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while still retaining important information. This analysis is useful when working with high-dimensional data that can be difficult to visualize or when trying to improve model performance.

5. Time Series Analysis - Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze time-dependent data. This analysis is used when the goal is to predict future values based on past trends and patterns.

## Methodology
1. Linear Regression: A simple model used to predict a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the input and output variables.

2. Logistic Regression: A model used to predict a binary outcome (0 or 1) based on one or more input variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the input and the log-odds of the output.

3. Decision Trees: A model that predicts the value of a target variable based on multiple input variables by making a series of binary decisions. It is easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data.

4. Random Forest: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

5. Support Vector Machines (SVM): A model that separates data points into different classes by finding the hyperplane with the maximum margin between the classes.

6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A model that classifies new data points based on their similarity to the training data points. It assumes that similar data points are likely to belong to the same class.

7. Neural Networks: A model that mimics the structure and function of the human brain to learn patterns in data. It can handle complex non-linear relationships and can be used for both regression and classification tasks.
